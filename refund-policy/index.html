    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <div>
      Effective as of 30th June 2020.
      Last updated on 30th June 2020.

      <p>
      The information provided below will help a User to understand our refund deadlines and policies.
      A User shall be entitled to a refund of 90% (ninety percent) of the course fee paid upon a refund request raised
      within 7 days from the date of payment, or until the User earns the certificate (if any), for the said course,
      whichever is earlier. The refund request shall be raised in the form and manner specified in this refund policy
      (‘Specified Manner’). Any refund request not raised in the Specified Manner shall be treated as null and void and
      AltCampus shall at its sole discretion be entitled to proceed or not proceed with such refund.
      In respect of this refund policy, the Specified Manner shall mean the refund request raised by the User by sending
      an email to <i>hello@altcampus.io</i>, specifying the User Name, the course details, the date of payment and the reason
      for seeking refund or by clicking on the refund tab and providing further details thereto. AltCampus shall refund
      the money to the original payment method, at its discretion, depending on the policies of AltCampus’s payment
      processing partners, the platform through which the course was purchased (Website or mobile app), and other
      factors.
      </p>
      <p>
      Except as specified in this Refund Policy, AltCampus shall not be obligated to provide refund to the Users.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing and unless explicitly stated otherwise, if a purchase is made by a User through
      third party marketplace (e.g. purchase made through alternative payment services or through Google play store or
      Apple App store) (‘Third Party Marketplace’), the terms and conditions and the refund policy applicable to such
      Third Party Marketplace shall apply. The refund process shall be governed by the refund policies of such Third
      Party Marketplace and such Third Party Marketplace shall be solely responsible for making such refunds. AltCampus
      hereby disclaims all responsibilities or liabilities arising out of such Third Party Marketplace’s refund policy
      or the third party’s compliance or non-compliance with its refund policy.
      Please note that AltCampus views and treats violations of its Terms of Use very seriously and shall have no
      obligation to offer refunds to Users who violate such terms, even if the refund request is made within the
      designated refund period as specified above.
